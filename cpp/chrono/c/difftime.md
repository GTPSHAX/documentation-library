double difftime( std::time_t time_end, std::time_t time_beg );
Computes difference between two calendar times as `std::time_t` objects (`time_end - time_beg`) in seconds. If `time_end` refers to time point before `time_beg` then the result is negative.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `time_beg, time_end` - times to compare

## Return value

Difference between two times in seconds.

## Notes

On POSIX systems, `std::time_t` is measured in seconds, and `difftime` is equivalent to arithmetic subtraction, but C and C++ allow fractional units for `time_t`.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::time_t start = std::time(nullptr);
    volatile double d = 1.0;

    // some time-consuming operation
    for (int p = 0; p < 10000; ++p)
        for (int q = 0; q < 100000; ++q)
            d = d + p * d * q + d;

    std::cout << "Wall time passed: "
              << std::difftime(std::time(nullptr), start) << " s.\n";
}
```


**Output:**
```
Wall time passed: 9 s.
```

```cpp
dcl|num=1|since=c++17|
filesystem_error( const std::string& what_arg,
std::error_code ec );
dcl|num=2|since=c++17|
filesystem_error( const std::string& what_arg,
const std::filesystem::path& p1,
std::error_code ec );
dcl|num=3|since=c++17|
filesystem_error( const std::string& what_arg,
const std::filesystem::path& p1,
const std::filesystem::path& p2,
std::error_code ec );
dcl|num=4|since=c++17|
filesystem_error( const filesystem_error& other ) noexcept;
```

Constructs a new `filesystem_error` object.
@1-3@ The error code is set to `ec` and optionally, the paths that were involved in the operation that resulted in the error, are set to `p1` and `p2`.  after construction returns a string that contains `what_arg` (assuming that it does not contain an embedded null character ). If either or both `path` arguments are not provided, a null `path` is used instead.
4. Copy constructor. Initialize the contents with those of `other`. If `*this` and `other` both have dynamic type `std::filesystem_error::filesystem_error` then `1=std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0`.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `what_arg` - explanatory string
- `ec` - error code for the specific operating system dependent error
- `p1, p2` - paths involved in the operation raising system error
- `other` - another `filesystem_error` object to copy

## Notes

Because copying `std::filesystem::filesystem_error` is not permitted to throw exceptions, the explanatory string is typically stored internally in a separately-allocated reference-counted storage. This is also why there is no constructor taking `std::string&&`: it would have to copy the content anyway.
Typical implementations also store `path` objects referenced by `path1()` and `path2()` in the reference-counted storage.

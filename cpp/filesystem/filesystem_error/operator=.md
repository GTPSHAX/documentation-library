title: std::filesystem::filesystem_error::operator=
type: Filesystem
source: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/filesystem_error/operator=
---


```cpp
dcl|since=c++17|1=
filesystem_error& operator=( const filesystem_error& other ) noexcept;
```

Assigns the contents with those of `other`. If `*this` and `other` both have dynamic type `std::filesystem::filesystem_error` then `1=std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0` after assignment.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `other` - another `filesystem_error` object to assign with

## Return value

`*this`

## Notes

Typical implementations store `path` objects referenced by `path1()` and `path2()` in a reference-counted storage. As a result, `*this` and `other` usually share their `path` objects after assignment.

## Example

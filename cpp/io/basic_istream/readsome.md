ddcl|
std::streamsize readsome( char_type* s, std::streamsize count );
Extracts up to `count` immediately available characters from the input stream. The extracted characters are stored into the character array pointed to by `s`.
Behaves as *UnformattedInputFunction*. After constructing and checking the sentry object,
* If `1=rdbuf()->in_avail() == -1`, calls `setstate(eofbit)` and extracts no characters.
* If `1=rdbuf()->in_avail() == 0`, extracts no characters.
* If `1=rdbuf()->in_avail() > 0`, extracts `std::min(rdbuf()->in_avail(), count)` characters and stores them into successive locations of the character array whose first element is pointed to by `s`.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `s` - pointer to the character array to store the characters to
- `count` - maximum number of characters to read

## Return value

The number of characters actually extracted.

## Exceptions


## Notes

The behavior of this function is highly implementation-specific. For example, using `readsome()` with `std::ifstream` leads to significant, implementation-specific outcomes. Some library implementations fill the underlying `filebuf` with data as soon as `std::ifstream` opens a file, which means `readsome()` always reads data and could even read the entire file.  With other implementations, `std::ifstream` only reads from a file when an input operation is invoked, which means calling `readsome()` immediately after opening the file never extracts any characters. Similarly, calling `std::cin.readsome()` may return all pending, unprocessed console input or may always return zero and extract no characters.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    char c[10] = "*********"; // c[9] == '\0'

    // std::stringbuf makes its entire buffer available for unblocking read
    std::istringstream input("This is sample text.");

    auto r = input.readsome(c, 5); // reads 'This ' and stores in c[0] .. c[4]
    assert(r == 5);
    std::cout << c << '\n';

    r = input.readsome(c, 9); // reads 'is sample' and stores in c[0] .. c[8]
    assert(r == 9);
    std::cout << c << '\n';
}
```


**Output:**
```
This ****
is sample
```

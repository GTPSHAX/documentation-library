virtual ~basic_istream();
Destructs the input stream.

## Notes

This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying streambuffer (`rdbuf()`): the destructors of the derived input streams such as `std::basic_ifstream` and `std::basic_istringstream` are responsible for calling the destructors of the streambuffers.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

void print_stringbuf(std::streambuf* p)
{
    std::istream buf(p); // buf shares the buffer with s1
    int n;
    buf >> n;
    std::cout << n;
} // calls the destructor of buf. p remains unaffected

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s1("10 20");
    print_stringbuf(s1.rdbuf());
    int n;
    s1 >> n;
    std::cout << ',' << n << '\n';
}
```


**Output:**
```
10,20
```

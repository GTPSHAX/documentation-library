```cpp
dcl|num=1|1=
basic_syncbuf()
: basic_syncbuf( nullptr )
dcl|num=2|1=
explicit basic_syncbuf( streambuf_type* obuf )
: basic_syncbuf( obuf, Allocator() ) {}
dcl|num=3|1=
basic_syncbuf( streambuf_type* obuf, const Allocator& a );
dcl|num=4|1=
basic_syncbuf( basic_syncbuf&& rhs );
```

1. Default constructor: creates an instance of `std::basic_syncbuf` with emit-on-sync policy set to `false`, wrapped streambuffer set to `nullptr`, and using default-constructed `Allocator` as the allocator for temporary storage.
@2,3@ Creates an instance of `std::basic_syncbuf` with emit-on-sync policy set to `false`, wrapped streambuffer set to `obuf`, and using `a` as the allocator for temporary storage.
4. Move constructor: move-constructs a `std::basic_syncbuf` object by moving all contents from another `std::basic_syncbuf` object `rhs`, including the temporary storage, the wrapped stream pointer, policy, and all other state (such as the mutex pointer). After move, `rhs` is not associated with a stream, and `1=rhs.get_wrapped() == nullptr`. The put area member pointers of the base class `std::basic_streambuf` of `rhs` are guaranteed to be null. Destroying a moved-from `rhs` will not produce any output.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `obuf` - pointer to the `std::basic_streambuf` to wrap
- `a` - the allocator to use for temporary storage
- `rhs` - another `std::basic_syncbuf` to move from

## Exceptions

@2,3@ May throw `std::bad_alloc` from the constructor of the internal temporary storage or `std::system_error` from the mutex construction.

## Notes

Typically called by the appropriate constructors of `std::basic_osyncstream`.

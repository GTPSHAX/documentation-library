ddcl|header=cstdio|
std::size_t fread( void* buffer, std::size_t size, std::size_t count, std::FILE* stream );
Reads up to `count` objects into the array `buffer` from the given input stream `stream` as if by calling `std::fgetc` `size` times for each object, and storing the results, in the order obtained, into the successive positions of `buffer`, which is reinterpreted as an array of `unsigned char`. The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the number of characters read.
If the objects are not *TriviallyCopyable*, the behavior is undefined.
If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is
indeterminate. If a partial element is read, its value is indeterminate.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `buffer` - pointer to the first object in the array to be read
- `size` - size of each object in bytes
- `count` - the number of the objects to be read
- `stream` - input file stream to read from

## Return value

Number of objects read successfully, which may be less than `count` if an error or end-of-file condition occurs.
If `size` or `count` is zero, `fread` returns zero and performs no other action.
`fread` does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use `std::feof` and `std::ferror` to determine which occurred.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    // Prepare file
    std::ofstream("test.txt") << 1 << ' ' << 2 << '\n';
    std::FILE* f = std::fopen("test.txt", "r");

    std::vector<char> buf(4); // char is trivially copyable
    const std::size_t n = std::fread(&buf[0], sizeof buf[0], buf.size(), f);

    std::cout << "Read " << n << " object" << (n > 1 ? "s" : "") << ": "
              << std::hex << std::uppercase << std::setfill('0');
    for (char n : buf)
        std::cout << "0x" << std::setw(2) << static_cast<short>(n) << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';

    std::vector<std::string> buf2; // string is not trivially copyable
//  This would result in undefined behavior:
//  std::fread(&buf2[0], sizeof buf2[0], buf2.size(), f);
}
```


**Output:**
```
Read 4 objects: 0x31 0x20 0x32 0x0A
```

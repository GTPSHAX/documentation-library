ddcl|header=cstdio|
int setvbuf( std::FILE* stream, char* buffer, int mode, std::size_t size );
Changes the buffering mode of the given file stream `stream` as indicated by the argument `mode`. In addition,
* If `buffer` is a null pointer, resizes the internal buffer to `size`.
* If `buffer` is not a null pointer, instructs the stream to use the user-provided buffer of size `size` beginning at `buffer`. The stream must be closed (with `std::fclose`) before the lifetime of the characters in [buffer, buffer + size) ends. The contents of the buffer after a successful call to `std::setvbuf` are indeterminate and any attempt to use it is undefined behavior.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `stream` - the file stream to set the buffer to
- `buffer` - pointer to a buffer for the stream to use or null pointer to change size and mode only
- `mode` - 2=buffering mode to use. It can be one of the following values:
- `size` - size of the buffer

## Return value

`0` on success or nonzero on failure.

## Notes

This function may only be used after `stream` has been associated with an open file, but before any other operation (other than a failed call to `std::setbuf`/`std::setvbuf`).
Not all `size` bytes will necessarily be used for buffering: the actual buffer size is usually rounded down to a multiple of 2, a multiple of page size, etc.
On many implementations, line buffering is only available for terminal input streams.
A common error is setting the buffer of `stdin` or `stdout` to an array whose lifetime ends before the program terminates:

```cpp
int main()
{
    char buf[BUFSIZ];
    std::setbuf(stdin, buf);
} // lifetime of buf ends, undefined behavior
```

The default buffer size `BUFSIZ` is expected to be the most efficient buffer size for file I/O on the implementation, but POSIX  often provides a better estimate.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main()
{
    std::FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    if (!fp)
    {
        std::perror("fopen");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    struct stat stats;
    if (fstat(fileno(fp), &stats) == -1) // POSIX only
    {
        std::perror("fstat");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    std::cout << "BUFSIZ is " << BUFSIZ << ", but optimal block size is "
              << stats.st_blksize << '\n';
    if (std::setvbuf(fp, nullptr, _IOFBF, stats.st_blksize) != 0)
    {
        std::perror("setvbuf failed"); // POSIX version sets errno
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    // Read entire file: use truss/strace to observe the read(2) syscalls used
    for (int ch; (ch = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF;)
    {}

    std::fclose(fp);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```


**Output:**
```
BUFSIZ is 8192, but optimal block size is 65536
```

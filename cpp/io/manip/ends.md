ddcl|header=ostream|
template< class CharT, class Traits >
std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& ends( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os );
Inserts a null character into the output sequence `os` as if by calling `os.put(CharT())`.
This is an output-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as `out << std::ends` for any `out` of type `std::basic_ostream`.

## Notes

This manipulator is typically used with `std::ostrstream`, when the associated output buffer needs to be null-terminated to be processed as a C string.
Unlike `std::endl`, this manipulator does not flush the stream.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `os` - reference to output stream

## Return value

`os` (reference to the stream after insertion of the null character).

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    std::ostrstream oss;
    oss << "Sample text: " << 42 << std::ends;
    std::printf("%s\n", oss.str());
    oss.freeze(false); // enable memory deallocation
}
```


**Output:**
```
Sample text: 42
```

# Default comparisons mark since c++20

Comparison operator functions can be explicitly defaulted to request the compiler to generate the corresponding default comparison for a class.

## Definition

A ''defaulted comparison operator function'' is a non-template comparison operator function (i.e. `1=<=>`, `1===`, `1=!=`, `<`, `>`, `1=<=`, or `1=>=`) satisfying all following conditions:
* It is a `non-static member` or `friend` of some class `C`.
* It is `defined as defaulted` in `C` or in a context where `C` is `complete`.
* It has two parameters of type `const C&` or two parameters of type `C`, where the `implicit object parameter` (if any) is considered to be the first parameter.
Such a comparison operator function is termed a ''defaulted comparison operator function for class `C`''.

```cpp
struct X
{
    bool operator==(const X&) const = default; // OK
    bool operator==(const X&) = default;       // Error: the implicit object
                                               //        parameter type is X&
    bool operator==(this X, X) = default;      // OK
};

struct Y
{
    friend bool operator==(Y, Y) = default;        // OK
    friend bool operator==(Y, const Y&) = default; // Error: different parameter types
};

bool operator==(const Y&, const Y&) = default;     // Error: not a friend of Y
```

Name lookups and access checks in the implicit definition of a comparison operator function are performed from a context equivalent to its function body. A definition of a comparison operator function as defaulted that appears in a class must be the first declaration of that function.

## Default comparison order

Given a class `C`, a subobject list is formed by the following subjects in order:
* The direct base class subobjects of `C`, in declaration order.
* The non-static `data members` of `C`, in declaration order.
:* If any member subobject is of array type, it is expanded to the sequence of its elements, in the order of increasing subscript. The expansion is recursive: array elements of array types will be expanded again until there is no subobject of array type.
For any object `x` of type `C`, in the following descriptions:
* Let `n` be the number of subobjects in the (expanded) subobject list for `x`.
* Let `x_i` be the `i`th subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for `x`, where `x_i` is formed by a sequence of `derived-to-base conversions`, `class member access expressions`, and `array subscript expressions` applied to `x`.

```cpp
struct S {};

struct T : S
{
    int arr[2][2];
} t;

// The subobject list for “t” consists of the following 5 subobjects in order:
// (S)t → t[0][0] → t[0][1] → t[1][0] → t[1][1]
```


## Three-way comparison

An `1=operator<=>` for a class type can be defined as defaulted with any return type.

### Comparison category types

There are three comparison category types:
*
*
*


| - |
| Type |
| Equivalent values are.. |
| Incomparable values are.. |
| - |
| ltt std | cpp/utility/compare/strong_ordering |
| indistinguishable |
| not allowed |
| - |
| ltt std | cpp/utility/compare/weak_ordering |
| distinguishable |
| not allowed |
| - |
| ltt std | cpp/utility/compare/partial_ordering |
| distinguishable |
| allowed |


### Synthesized three-way comparison

The ''synthesized three-way comparison'' of type `T` between glvalues `a` and `b` of the same type is defined as follows:
* If the overload resolution for `1=a <=> b` results in a usable candidate, and can be explicitly converted to `T` using `static_cast`, the synthesized comparison is `1=static_cast<T>(a <=> b)`.
* Otherwise, if any of the following condition is satisfied, the synthesized comparison is not defined:
:* The overload resolution for `1=a <=> b` finds at least one viable candidate.
:* `T` is not a comparison category type.
:* The overload resolution for `1=a == b` does not result in a usable candidate.
:* The overload resolution for `a < b` does not result in a usable candidate.
* Otherwise, if `T` is , the synthesized comparison is

```cpp
a == b ? std::strong_ordering::equal :
a < b  ? std::strong_ordering::less :
         std::strong_ordering::greater
```

* Otherwise, if `T` is , the synthesized comparison is

```cpp
a == b ? std::weak_ordering::equivalent :
a < b  ? std::weak_ordering::less :
         std::weak_ordering::greater
```

* Otherwise (`T` is ), the synthesized comparison is

```cpp
a == b ? std::partial_ordering::equivalent :
a < b  ? std::partial_ordering::less :
b < a  ? std::partial_ordering::greater : 
         std::partial_ordering::unordered
```


### Placeholder return type

If the declared return type of a defaulted three-way comparison operator function (`1=operator<=>`) for a class type `C` is `auto`, the return type is deduced from the return types of the three-way comparisons between the corresponding subobjects of an object `x` of type `C`.
For each subobject `x_i` in the (expanded) subobject list for `x`:
# Perform overload resolution for `1=x_i <=> x_i`, if the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted `1=operator<=>` is defined as deleted.
# Denote the cv-unqualified version of the type of `1=x_i <=> x_i` as `R_i`, if `R_i` is not a comparison category type, the defaulted `1=operator<=>` is defined as deleted.
If the defaulted `1=operator<=>` is not defined as deleted, its return type is deduced as `std::common_comparison_category_t<R_1, R_2, ..., R_n>`.

### Non-placeholder return type

If the declared return type of the defaulted `1=operator<=>` is not `auto`, it cannot contain any `placeholder type` (e.g. `decltype(auto)`).
If there is a subobject `x_i` in the (expanded) subobject list for `x` such that the synthesized three-way comparison of the declared return type between `x_i` and `x_i` is not defined, the defaulted `1=operator<=>` is defined as deleted.

### Comparison result

Let `x` and `y` be the parameters of a defaulted `1=operator<=>`, denote each subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for `x` and `y` as `x_i` and `y_i` respectively. The default three-way comparison between `x` and `y` is performed by comparing corresponding subobjects `x_i` and `y_i` with increasing `i` order.
Let `R` be the (possibly-deduced) return type, the comparison result between `x_i` and `y_i` is the result of the synthesized three-way comparison of type `R` between `x_i` and `y_i`.
* During the default three-way comparison between `x` and `y`, if a subobject-wise comparison between `x_i` and `y_i` generates a result `v_i` such that contextually converting `1=v_i != 0` to `bool` yields `true`, the return value is a copy of `v_i` (the remaining subobjects will not be compared).
* Otherwise, the return value is `static_cast<R>(std::strong_ordering::equal)`.

### Example

```cpp
#include <compare>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

struct Point
{
    int x;
    int y;
    auto operator<=>(const Point&) const = default;
    /* non-comparison functions */
};

int main()
{
    Point pt1{1, 1}, pt2{1, 2};
    std::set<Point> s; // OK
    s.insert(pt1);     // OK

    // two-way comparison operator functions are not required to be explicitly defined:
    // operator== is implicitly declared (see below)
    // the overload resolutions of other candidates will select rewritten candidates 
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
        << (pt1 == pt2) << ' '  // false
        << (pt1 != pt2) << ' '  // true
        << (pt1 <  pt2) << ' '  // true
        << (pt1 <= pt2) << ' '  // true
        << (pt1 >  pt2) << ' '  // false
        << (pt1 >= pt2) << ' '; // false
}
```


## Equality comparison


### Explicit declaration

An `1=operator==` for a class type can be defined as defaulted with return type `bool`.
Given a class `C` and an object `x` of type `C`, if there is a subobject `x_i` in the (expanded) subobject list for `x` such that the overload resolution for `1=x_i == x_i` does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted `1=operator==` is defined as deleted.
Let `x` and `y` be the parameters of a defaulted `1=operator==`, denote each subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for `x` and `y` as `x_i` and `y_i` respectively. The default equality comparison between `x` and `y` is performed by comparing corresponding subobjects `x_i` and `y_i` with increasing `i` order.
The comparison result between `x_i` and `y_i` is the result of `1=x_i == y_i`.
* During the default equality comparison between `x` and `y`, if a subobject-wise comparison between `x_i` and `y_i` generates a result `v_i` such that contextually converting `v_i` to `bool` yields `false`, the return value is `false` (the remaining subobjects will not be compared).
* Otherwise, the return value is `true`.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Point
{
    int x;
    int y;
    bool operator==(const Point&) const = default;
    /* non-comparison functions */
};

int main()
{
    Point pt1{3, 5}, pt2{2, 5};
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
        << (pt1 != pt2) << '\n'  // true
        << (pt1 == pt1) << '\n'; // true

    struct [[maybe_unused]] { int x{}, y{}; } p, q;
    // if (p == q) {} // Error: operator== is not defined
}
```


### Implicit declaration

If a class `C` does not explicitly declare any member or friend named `1=operator==`, an `==` operator function is declared implicitly for each `1=operator<=>` defined as defaulted. Each implicity-declared `1=operator==` have the same access and  and in the same  as the respective defaulted `1=operator<=>`, with the following changes:
* The `declarator identifier` is replaced with `1=operator==`.
* The return type is replaced with `bool`.

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct X
{
    friend constexpr std::partial_ordering operator<=>(X, X)
        requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;
    // implicitly declares: friend constexpr bool operator==(X, X)
    //                          requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;

    [[nodiscard]] virtual std::strong_ordering operator<=>(const X&) const = default;
    // implicitly declares: [[nodiscard]] virtual bool
    //                          operator==(const X&) const = default;
};
```


## Secondary comparison

A secondary comparison operator function (`1=!=`, `<`, `>`, `1=<=`, or `1=>=`) for a class type can be defined as defaulted with return type `bool`.
Let `@` be one of the five secondary comparison operators, for each defaulted `operator@` with parameters `x` and `y`, up to two overloads resolutions are performed (not considering the defaulted `operator@` as a candidate) to determine whether it is defined as deleted.
* The first overload resolution is performed for `x @ y`. If the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, or the selected candidate is not a `rewritten candidate`, the defaulted `operator@` is defined as deleted. There is no second overload resolution in these cases.
* The second overload resolution is performed for the selected rewritten candidate of `x @ y`. If the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted `operator@` is defined as deleted.
If is `x @ y` cannot be implicitly converted to `bool`, the defaulted `operator@` is defined as deleted.
If the defaulted `operator@` is not defined as deleted, it yields `x @ y`.

```cpp
struct HasNoRelational {};

struct C
{
    friend HasNoRelational operator<=>(const C&, const C&);
    bool operator<(const C&) const = default; // OK, function is defaulted
};
```

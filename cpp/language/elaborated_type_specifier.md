# Elaborated type specifier

Elaborated type specifiers may be used to refer to a previously-declared class name (class, struct, or union) or to a previously-declared enum name even if the name was `hidden by a non-type declaration`. They may also be used to declare new class names.

## Syntax


**Syntax:**

- `sdsc|num=1|`
- `*class-key* *class-name*`
- `sdsc|num=2|`
- `**`enum`** *enum-name*`
- `sdsc|num=3|`
- `*class-key* *attr* (optional) *identifier* **`;`**`

### Parameters

- `{{spar` - class-key|one of , , 
- `{{spar` - class-name|the name of a previously-declared class type, optionally qualified, or an identifier not previously declared as a type name
- `{{spar` - enum-name|the name of a previously-declared enumeration type, optionally qualified
- `{{spar` - attr|<sup>(C++11)</sup> any number of `attributes`
1. Elaborated type specifier for a class type.
2. Elaborated type specifier for an enumeration type.
3. A declaration that consists solely of an elaborated type specifier always declares a class type named by *identifier* in the `scope` that contains the declaration.
`Opaque enum declaration` resembles form , but the enum type is a complete type after an opaque enum declaration.

## Explanation

Form  is a special case of elaborated type specifier, usually referred to as ''forward declaration'' of classes, for the description of form , see . The following only apply to form  and .
The *class-name* or *enum-name* in the elaborated type specifier may either be a simple identifier or be a `qualified-id`. The name is looked up using `unqualified name lookup` or `qualified name lookup`, depending on their appearance. But in either case, non-type names are not considered.

```cpp
class T
{
public:
    class U;
private:
    int U;
};

int main()
{
    int T;
    T t; // error: the local variable T is found
    class T t; // OK: finds ::T, the local variable T is ignored
    T::U* u; // error: lookup of T::U finds the private data member
    class T::U* u; // OK: the data member is ignored
}
```

If the name lookup does not find a previously declared type name, the elaborated-type-specifier is introduced by **`class`**, **`struct`**, or **`union`** (i.e. not by **`enum`**), and *class-name* is an unqualified identifier, then the elaborated-type-specifier is a class declaration of the class-name, and the target scope is the nearest enclosing namespace or block scope.

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct Node
{
    struct Node* Next; // OK: lookup of Node finds the injected-class-name
    struct Data* Data; // OK: declares type Data at global scope
                       // and also declares the data member Data
    friend class ::List; // error: cannot introduce a qualified name
    enum Kind* kind; // error: cannot introduce an enum
};

Data* p; // OK: struct Data has been declared
```

If the name refers to a `typedef name`, a `type alias`, a `template type parameter`, or an `alias template specialization`, the program is ill-formed, otherwise the elaborated type specifier introduces the name into the declaration the same way a `simple type specifier` introduces its type-name.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Node
{
    friend class T; // error: type parameter cannot appear in an elaborated type specifier;
                    // note that similar declaration `friend T;` is OK.
};

class A {};
enum b { f, t };

int main()
{
    class A a; // OK: equivalent to 'A a;'
    enum b flag; // OK: equivalent to 'b flag;'
}
```

The *class-key* or **`enum`** keyword present in the elaborated-type-specifier must agree in kind with the declaration to which the name in the elaborated-type-specifier refers.
* the **`enum`** keyword must be used to refer to an `enumeration type` (whether scoped or unscoped)
* the **`union`** *class-key* must be used to refer to a `union`
* either the **`class`** or **`struct`** *class-key* must be used to refer to a non-union class type (the keywords **`class`** and **`struct`** are interchangeable here).

```cpp
enum class E { a, b };
enum E x = E::a; // OK
enum class E y = E::b; // error: 'enum class' cannot introduce an elaborated type specifier

struct A {};
class A a; // OK
```

When used as a `template argument`, `class T` is a type template parameter named `T`, not an unnamed non-type parameter whose type `T` is introduced by elaborated type specifier.

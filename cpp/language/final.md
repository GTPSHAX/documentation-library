# tt|final

Specifies that a `virtual function` cannot be overridden in a derived class, or that a class cannot be `derived from`.

## Syntax

When applied to a member function, the identifier `final` appears immediately after the `declarator` in the syntax of a member function declaration or a member function definition inside a class definition.
When applied to a class (including struct and union), the identifier `final` appears at the beginning of the class definition, immediately after the name of the class, and cannot appear in a class declaration.

**Syntax:**

- `*virt-specifier-seq* (optional) *pure-specifier* (optional)`
- `*virt-specifier-seq* (optional) *function-body*`
- `*attr* (optional) *class-head-name* *class-virt-specifier* (optional) *base-clause* (optional)`
1. In a member function declaration, `final` may appear in *virt-specifier-seq* immediately after the declarator, and before the `*pure-specifier`*, if used.
2. In a member function definition inside a class definition, `final` may appear in *virt-specifier-seq* immediately after the declarator and just before *function-body*.
3. In a class definition, `final` may appear as *class-virt-specifier* immediately after the name of the class, just before the colon that begins the *base-clause*, if used.
In the cases , *virt-specifier-seq*, if used, is either `override` or `final`, or `final override` or `override final`. In the case , the only allowed value of *class-virt-specifier*, if used, is `final`.

## Explanation

When used in a virtual function declaration or definition, `final` specifier ensures that the function is virtual and specifies that it may not be overridden by derived classes. The program is ill-formed (a compile-time error is generated) otherwise.
When used in a class definition, `final` specifies that this class may not appear in the *base-specifier-list* of another class definition (in other words, cannot be derived from). The program is ill-formed otherwise (a compile-time error is generated). `final` can also be used with a `union` definition, in which case it has no effect<sup>(since C++14)</sup>  (other than on the outcome of `std::is_final`), since unions cannot be derived from.
`final` is an identifier with a special meaning when used in a member function declaration or class head. In other contexts, it is not reserved and may be used to name objects and functions.

## Note

In a sequence of the following tokens:
# one of `class`, `struct` and `union`
# a possibly qualified `identifier`
# `final`
# one of `:` and `{`
the third token `final` in the sequence is always considered as a specifier instead of an identifier.

### Example

```cpp
struct A;
struct A final {}; // OK, definition of struct A,
                   // not value-initialization of variable final

struct X
{
    struct C { constexpr operator int() { return 5; } };
    struct B final : C{}; // OK, definition of nested class B,
                          // not declaration of a bit-field member final
};

// Abnormal final usage.

struct final final // OK, definition of a struct named “final” from which
{                  // you cannot inherit
};

// struct final final {}; // Error: redefinition of “struct final”, NOT a
                          // definition of a variable “final” using an elaborated
                          // type specifier “struct final” followed by an
                          // aggregate initialization

// struct override : final {}; // Error: cannot derive from final base type;
                               // “override” in given context is a normal name
void foo()
{
    [[maybe_unused]]
    final final; // OK, declaration of a variable named “final” of type
                 // “struct final”
}

struct final final; // OK, declaration of a variable named “final” of type
                    // “struct final” using an elaborated type specifier
int main()
{
}
```

## Example


### Example

```cpp
struct Base
{
    virtual void foo();
};

struct A : Base
{
    void foo() final; // Base::foo is overridden and A::foo is the final override
    void bar() final; // Error: bar cannot be final as it is non-virtual
};

struct B final : A // struct B is final
{
    void foo() override; // Error: foo cannot be overridden as it is final in A
};

struct C : B {}; // Error: B is final
```


**Output:**
```
main.cpp:9:10: error: 'void A::bar()' marked 'final', but is not virtual
    9 {{!
```

# tt|goto

Transfers control unconditionally.
Used when it is otherwise impossible to transfer control to the desired location using other statements.

## Syntax


**Syntax:**

- `**`goto`** *label* **`;`**`

## Explanation

The `goto` statement transfers control to the location specified by `label`. The `goto` statement must be in the same function as the *label* it is referring, it may appear before or after the label.
If transfer of control exits the scope of any automatic variables (e.g. by jumping backwards to a point before the declarations of such variables or by jumping forward out of a compound statement where the variables are scoped), the destructors are called for all variables whose scope was exited, in the order opposite to the order of their construction.
The `goto` statement cannot transfer control into a `control-flow-limited statement`, but can transfer control out of a control-flow-limited statement (the rules above regarding automatic variables in scope are followed).
If transfer of control enters the scope of any automatic variables (e.g. by jumping forward over a declaration statement), the program is ill-formed (cannot be compiled), unless all variables whose scope is entered have the following types:
* scalar types declared without initializers
* class types with trivial default constructors and trivial destructors declared without initializers
* cv-qualified versions of one of the above
* arrays of one of the above
(Note: the same rules apply to all forms of transfer of control)

## Notes

In the C programming language, the `goto` statement has fewer restrictions and can enter the scope of any variable other than variable-length array or variably-modified pointer.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Object
{
    // non-trivial destructor
    ~Object() { std::cout << 'd'; }
};

struct Trivial
{
    double d1;
    double d2;
}; // trivial ctor and dtor

int main()
{
    int a = 10;

    // loop using goto
label:
    Object obj;
    std::cout << a << ' ';
    a -= 2;

    if (a != 0)
        goto label;  // jumps out of scope of obj, calls obj destructor
    std::cout << '\n';

    // goto can be used to efficiently leave a multi-level (nested) loops
    for (int x = 0; x < 3; ++x)
        for (int y = 0; y < 3; ++y)
        {
            std::cout << '(' << x << ',' << y << ") " << '\n';
            if (x + y >= 3)
                goto endloop;
        }

endloop:
    std::cout << '\n';

    goto label2; // jumps into the scope of n and t

    [[maybe_unused]] int n; // no initializer

    [[maybe_unused]] Trivial t; // trivial ctor/dtor, no initializer

//  int x = 1;   // error: has initializer
//  Object obj2; // error: non-trivial dtor

label2:
    {
        Object obj3;
        goto label3; // jumps forward, out of scope of obj3
    }

label3:
    std::cout << '\n';
}
```


**Output:**
```
10 d8 d6 d4 d2
(0,0)
(0,1)
(0,2)
(1,0)
(1,1)
(1,2)

d

```

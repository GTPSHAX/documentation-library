# tt|return

Terminates the current function and returns the specified value (if any) to the caller.

## Syntax


**Syntax:**

- `sdsc|num=1|1=`
- `*attr* (optional) **`return`** *expression* (optional) **`;`**`
- `|1=`
- `*attr* (optional) **`return`** *braced-init-list* **`;`**`
- `|1=`
- `*attr* (optional) **`co_return`** *expression* (optional) **`;`**`
- `|1=`
- `*attr* (optional) **`co_return`** *braced-init-list* **`;`**`

### Parameters

- `{{spar` - attr|<sup>(C++11)</sup> sequence of any number of `attributes`
- `{{spar` - expression|`expression`, convertible to the function return type
- `{{spar` - braced-init-list|`brace-enclosed initializer list`

## Explanation

1. Evaluates the *expression*, terminates the current function and returns the result of the *expression* to the caller, after `implicit conversion` to the function return type. The *expression* is optional in functions whose return type is (possibly cv-qualified) `void`, and disallowed in constructors and in destructors.
2. Uses `copy-list-initialization` to construct the return value of the function.
@3,4@ In a coroutine, the keyword `co_return` must be used instead of `return` for the final suspension point (see `coroutines` for details).
The *expression* <sup>(since C++11)</sup> or *braced-init-list* (if any) is known as the ''operand'' of the `return` statement.
rev|until=c++11|
There is a `sequence point` between the copy-initialization of the result of the function call and the destruction of all temporaries at the end of *expression*.
rev|since=c++11|
The copy-initialization of the result of the function call is `sequenced-before` the destruction of all temporaries at the end of *expression*, which, in turn, is ''sequenced-before'' the destruction of local variables of the block enclosing the `return` statement.
rev|since=c++26|
If the return type of the function is a reference type and a `return` statement  binds the returned reference to the result of a temporary expression, the program is ill-formed.
If control reaches the end of
* a function with the return type (possibly cv-qualified) `void`,
* a constructor,
* a destructor, or
* a `function `try` block` for a function with the return type (possibly cv-qualified) `void`
without encountering a `return` statement, `return;` is executed.
If control reaches the end of the ``main` function`, `return 0;` is executed.
Flowing off the end of a value-returning function, except the `main` function<sup>(since C++20)</sup>  and specific `coroutines`, without a `return`  statement is undefined behavior.
In a function returning (possibly cv-qualified) `void`, the `return` statement with *expression* can be used, if the expression type is (possibly cv-qualified) `void`.
rrev|since=c++14|
If the return type of a function is specified as a `placeholder type`, it will be `deduced` from the return value. If `decltype(auto)` is used, the type deduction treats an *expression* that can be an *entity* as an *entity*.

## Notes

Returning by value may involve construction and copy/move of a temporary object, unless `copy elision` is used. Specifically, the conditions for copy/move are as follows:
rev|since=c++11|

### Automatic move from local variables and parameters

The *expression* is ''move-eligible'' if it is a (possibly parenthesized) `identifier expression` that names a variable of automatic storage duration whose type is
* a non-volatile object type
rev|since=c++20|
* or a non-volatile rvalue reference to object type
rev|since=c++11|
and that variable is declared
* in the body
* or as a parameter
of the innermost enclosing function or lambda expression.
rev|since=c++11|until=c++23|
If the *expression* is move-eligible, `overload resolution` to select the constructor to use for initialization of the returned value<sup>(since C++20)</sup>  or, for `co_return`, to select the overload of `promise.return_value()` is performed ''twice'':
* first as if *expression* were an rvalue expression (thus it may select the `move constructor`), and
:* if the first overload resolution failed
rev|since=c++11|until=c++20|
:* or it succeeded, but did not select the `move constructor` (formally, the first parameter of the selected constructor was not an rvalue reference to the (possibly cv-qualified) type of *expression*)
rev|since=c++11|until=c++23|
* then overload resolution is performed as usual, with *expression* considered as an lvalue (so it may select the `copy constructor`).
rev|since=c++23|
If the *expression* is move-eligible, it is treated as an xvalue (thus overload resolution may select the `move constructor`).
rev|since=c++17|

### Guaranteed copy elision

If *expression* is a prvalue, the result object is initialized directly by that expression. This does not involve a copy or move constructor when the types match (see `copy elision`).

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <utility>

void fa(int i)
{
    if (i == 2)
        return;
    std::cout << "fa("<< i << ")\n";
} // implied return;

int fb(int i)
{
    if (i > 4)
        return 4;
    std::cout << "fb(" << i << ")\n";
    return 2;
}

std::pair<std::string, int> fc(const char* p, int x)
{
    return {p, x};
}

void fd()
{
    return fa(10); // fa(10) is a void expression
}

int main()
{
    fa(1); // prints its argument, then returns
    fa(2); // does nothing when i == 2, just returns

    int i = fb(5); // returns 4
    i = fb(i);     // prints its argument, returns 2
    std::cout << "i = " << i << '\n'
              << "fc(~).second = " << fc("Hello", 7).second << '\n';

    fd();
}

struct MoveOnly
{
    MoveOnly() = default;
    MoveOnly(MoveOnly&&) = default;
};

MoveOnly move_11(MoveOnly arg)
{
    return arg; // OK. implicit move
}

MoveOnly move_11(MoveOnly&& arg)
{
    return arg; // OK since C++20. implicit move
}

MoveOnly&& move_23(MoveOnly&& arg)
{
    return arg; // OK since C++23. implicit move
}
```


**Output:**
```
fa(1)
fb(4)
i = 2
fc(~).second = 7
fa(10)
```

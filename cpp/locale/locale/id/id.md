title: std::locale::id::id
type: Localizations
source: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/locale/id/id
---


```cpp
**Header:** `<`locale`>`
dcl|num=1|1=
id();
dcl|num=2|1=
id( const id& ) = delete;
```

1. Default constructor: creates an object of type `std::locale::id` with implementation-specific content.
2. Copy constructor is deleted; `std::locale::id` is not copyable.

## Notes

Because locales and facets must be available for the IO stream objects with static storage duration, such as `std::cout`, typical implementations let implicit default constructor zero-initialize the contents of `std::locale::id` during static initialization (before constructors run for static objects), and when a facet is added to any locale for the first time, the locale completes initialization of the facet's `id`.

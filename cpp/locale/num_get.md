class CharT,
class InputIt = std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT>
> class num_get;
Class `std::num_get` encapsulates the rules for parsing string representations of numeric values. Specifically, types `bool`, `unsigned short`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`<sup>(since C++11)</sup> , `long long`, `unsigned long long`, `float`, `double`, `long double`, and `void*` are supported. The standard formatting input operators (such as `cin >> n;`) use the `std::num_get` facet of the I/O stream's locale to parse the text representations of the numbers.
If a `std::num_get` specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its `get()` and `do_get()` are not guaranteed as specified.

## Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are `required to be implemented by any locale object`):


| locale | |

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:
* `CharT` is one of
** `char`,
** `wchar_t`, and
** any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and
* `InputIt` must meet the requirements of *InputIterator*.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string de_double = "1.234.567,89";
    std::string us_double = "1,234,567.89";

    // parse using streams
    std::istringstream de_in(de_double);
    de_in.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
    double f1;
    de_in >> f1;

    std::istringstream us_in(de_double);
    us_in.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    double f2;
    us_in >> f2;

    std::cout << "Parsing " << de_double << " as double gives " << std::fixed
              << f1 << " in de_DE locale and " << f2 << " in en_US\n";

    // use the facet directly
    std::istringstream s3(us_double);
    s3.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_get<char>>(s3.getloc());
    std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s3), end;
    double f3;
    std::ios::iostate err;
    f.get(beg, end, s3, err, f3);

    std::cout << "parsing " << us_double
              << " as double using raw en_US facet gives " << f3 << '\n';
}
```


**Output:**
```
Parsing 1.234.567,89 as double gives 1234567.890000 in de_DE locale and 1.234000 in en_US
parsing 1,234,567.89 as double using raw en_US facet gives 1234567.890000
```

ddcl|since=c++17|1=
virtual void* do_allocate( std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment );
Allocates storage.
If the ''current buffer'' has sufficient unused space to fit a block with the specified size and alignment, allocates the return block from the current buffer.
Otherwise, this function allocates a new buffer by calling `upstream_resource()->allocate(n, m)`, where `n` is not less than the greater of `bytes` and the ''next buffer size'' and `m` is not less than `alignment`. It sets the new buffer as the ''current buffer'',  increases the ''next buffer size'' by an implementation-defined growth factor (which is not necessarily integral), and then allocates the return block from the newly allocated buffer.

## Return value

A pointer to allocated storage of at least `bytes` bytes in size, aligned to the specified `alignment` if such alignment is supported, and to `alignof(std::max_align_t)` otherwise.

## Exceptions

Throws nothing unless calling `allocate()` on the upstream memory resource throws.

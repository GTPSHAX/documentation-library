```cpp
dcl | since=c++17|1=
enum class align_val_t : std::size_t {};
```

Both new-expression and delete-expression, when used with objects whose alignment requirement is greater than `__STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__`, pass that alignment requirement as an argument of type `std::align_val_t` to the selected allocation/deallocation function.

## Notes

Alignment (as obtained by `alignof`) has the type `std::size_t`, but placement forms of allocation and deallocation functions that take `std::size_t` as an additional parameter are already in use, so this type is used instead.

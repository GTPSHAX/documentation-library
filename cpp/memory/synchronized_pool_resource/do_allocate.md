ddcl|since=c++17|1=
virtual void* do_allocate( std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment );
Allocates storage.
If the pool selected for a block of size `bytes` is unable to satisfy the request from its internal data structures, calls `allocate()` on the upstream memory resource to obtain memory.
If the size requested is larger than what the largest pool can handle, memory is allocated by calling `allocate()` on the upstream memory resource.

## Return value

A pointer to allocated storage of at least `bytes` bytes in size, aligned to the specified `alignment` if such alignment is supported, and to `alignof(std::max_align_t)` otherwise.

## Exceptions

Throws nothing unless calling `allocate()` on the upstream memory resource throws.

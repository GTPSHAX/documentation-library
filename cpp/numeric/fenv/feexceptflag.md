```cpp
dcl | since=c++11 | num=1|
int fegetexceptflag( std::fexcept_t* flagp, int excepts );
dcl | since=c++11 | num=2|
int fesetexceptflag( const std::fexcept_t* flagp, int excepts );
```

1) Attempts to obtain the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are listed in the bitmask argument `excepts`, which is a bitwise OR of the floating point exception macros.
2) Attempts to copy the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are listed in `excepts` from `flagp` into the floating-point environment. Does not raise any exceptions, only modifies the flags.
The full contents of a floating-point exception flag is not necessarily a boolean value indicating whether the exception is raised or cleared. For example, it may be a struct which includes the boolean status and the address of the code that triggered the exception. These functions obtain all such content and obtain/store it in `flagp` in implementation-defined format.

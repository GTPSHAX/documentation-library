ddcl|header=cstdlib|
void srand( unsigned seed );
Seeds the pseudo-random number generator used by `std::rand()` with the value `seed`.
If `std::rand()` is used before any calls to `srand()`, `std::rand()` behaves as if it was seeded with `srand(1)`.
Each time `std::rand()` is seeded with the same `seed`, it must produce the same sequence of values.
`srand()` is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `seed` - the seed value

## Return value

(none)

## Notes

Generally speaking, the pseudo-random number generator should only be seeded once, before any calls to `rand()`, at the start of the program.
It should not be repeatedly seeded, or reseeded every time you wish to generate a new batch of pseudo-random numbers.
Standard practice is to use the result of a call to `std::time(0)` as the seed.
However, `std::time` returns a `std::time_t` value, and `std::time_t` is not guaranteed to be an integral type.
In practice, though, every major implementation defines `std::time_t` to be an integral type, and this is also what POSIX requires.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

int main() 
{
    std::srand(std::time(0)); // use current time as seed for random generator
    std::cout << "Random value on [0, " << RAND_MAX << "]: " << std::rand() << '\n';
}
```


**Output:**
```
Random value on [0, 2147483647]: 1373858591
```

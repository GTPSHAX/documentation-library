```cpp
**Header:** `<`ranges`>`
dcl|num=1|since=c++20|1=
template<class T>
concept view = ranges::range<T> && std::movable<T> && ranges::enable_view<T>;
dcl|num=2|since=c++20|1=
template<class T>
constexpr bool enable_view =
std::derived_from<T, view_base>  /*is-derived-from-view-interface*/<T>;
dcl|num=3|since=c++20|
struct view_base { };
```

1. The `view` concept specifies the requirements of a  type that has suitable semantic properties for use in constructing range adaptor pipelines.
2. The `enable_view` variable template is used to indicate whether a  is a `view`. `/*is-derived-from-view-interface*/<T>` is `true` if and only if `T` has exactly one public base class `ranges::view_interface<U>` for some type `U`, and `T` has no base classes of type `ranges::view_interface<V>` for any other type `V`.
<br>Users may specialize `enable_view` to `true` for cv-unqualified program-defined types which model `view`, and `false` for types which do not. Such specializations must be usable in constant expressions and have type `const bool`.
3. Deriving from `view_base` enables  types to model `view`.

## Semantic requirements

1. `T` models `view` only if:
* move construction of `T` has constant time complexity, and
* if  copies and/or moves are made from a `T` object holding  elements, then these  objects have mathjax-or|\(\scriptsize \mathcal{O}{(N+M)}\)|𝓞(N+M) destruction (which implies that a moved-from `view` object has mathjax-or|\(\scriptsize \mathcal{O}{(1)}\)|𝓞(1) destruction), and
* either `std::copy_constructible<T>` is `false`, or copy construction of `T` has constant time complexity, and
* either `std::copyable<T>` is `false`, or copy assignment of `T` has no more time complexity than destruction followed by copy construction.

## Specializations

Specializations of `enable_view` for all specializations of the following standard templates are defined as `true`:
* `cpp/string/basic_string_view|std::basic_string_view`
* `cpp/container/span|std::span`
rrev|since=c++26|1=
* `cpp/utility/optional|std::optional`

## Notes

Examples of `view` types are:
* A  type that wraps a pair of iterators, e.g., `std::ranges::subrange<I>`.
* A  type that holds its elements by `std::shared_ptr` and shares ownership with all its copies.
* A  type that generates its elements on demand, e.g., `std::ranges::iota_view`.
A copyable container such as `std::vector<std::string>` generally does not meet the semantic requirements of `view` since copying the container copies all of the elements, which cannot be done in constant time.
While views were originally described as cheaply copyable and non-owning ranges, a type is not required to be copyable or non-owning for it to model `view`. However, it must still be cheap to copy (if it is copyable), move, assign, and destroy, so that  will not have unexpected complexity.
By default, a type modeling  and  is considered a view if it is publicly and unambiguously derived from `view_base`, or exactly one specialization of `std::ranges::view_interface`.

## Example

A minimum view.

```cpp
#include <ranges>

struct ArchetypalView : std::ranges::view_interface<ArchetypalView>
{
    int* begin();
    int* end();
};

static_assert(std::ranges::view<ArchetypalView>);
```

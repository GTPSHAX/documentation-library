template< class Operation >
constexpr void resize_and_overwrite( size_type count, Operation op );
Resizes the string to contain at most `count` characters, using the user-provided operation `op` to modify the possibly indeterminate contents and set the length. This avoids the cost of initializing a suitably-sized `std::string` when it is intended to be used as a char array to be populated by, e.g., a C API call.
This function performs the following steps:
# Obtains contiguous storage that contains `count + 1` characters, and makes its first `k` characters equal to the first `k` characters of `*this`, where `k` is the smaller of `count` and the result of `size()` before the call to `resize_and_overwrite`. Let `p` denote the pointer to the first character in the storage.
#* The equality is determined as if by checking `1=this->compare(0, k, p, k) == 0`.
#* The characters in  may have indeterminate values.
# Evaluates `std::move(op)(p, count)`, let `r` be the return value.
# Replaces the contents of `*this` with [p, p + r) (which sets the length of `*this` to `r`). Invalidates all pointers and references to the range .
If `r` is not of an integer-like type, the program is ill-formed.
If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:
* `std::move(op)(p, count)` throws an exception.
* `std::move(op)(p, count)` modifies `p` or `count`.
* `r` is not in the range .
* Any character in range [p, p + r) has an indeterminate value.
Implementations are recommended to avoid unnecessary copies and allocations by, e.g., making `p` equal to the pointer to beginning of storage of characters allocated for `*this` after the call, which can be identical to the existing storage of `*this` if `count` is less than or equal to `capacity()`.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `count` - the maximal possible new size of the string
- `op` - the function object used for setting the new contents of the string

## Exceptions

`std::length_error` if `count > max_size()`.
Any exceptions thrown by corresponding `Allocator`.
If an exception is thrown from `std::move(op)(p, count)`, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, if an exception is thrown, this function has no effect.

## Notes

`resize_and_overwrite` invalidates all iterators, pointers, and references into `*this`, regardless whether reallocation occurs. Implementations may assume that the contents of the string are not aliased after the call to `resize_and_overwrite`.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
static_assert(__cpp_lib_string_resize_and_overwrite);

constexpr std::string_view fruits[]{"apple", "banana", "coconut", "date", "elderberry"};

int main()
{
    // A simple case, append only fruits[0]. The string size will be increased.
    std::string s{"Food: "};
    s.resize_and_overwrite(16, [sz = s.size()](char* buf, std::size_t buf_size) noexcept
    {
        const auto to_copy = std::min(buf_size - sz, fruits[0].size());
        std::memcpy(buf + sz, fruits[0].data(), to_copy);
        return sz + to_copy;
    });
    std::cout << "1. " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';

    // The size shrinking case. Note, that the user's lambda is always invoked.
    s.resize_and_overwrite(10, [](char* buf, int n) noexcept
    {
        return std::find(buf, buf + n, ':') - buf;
    });
    std::cout << "2. " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';

    std::cout << "3. Copy data until the buffer is full. Print data and sizes.\n";
    std::string food{"Food:"};
    const auto resize_to{27};
    std::cout << "Initially, food.size: " << food.size()
              << ", food.capacity: " << food.capacity()
              << ", resize_to: " << resize_to
              << ", food: " << std::quoted(food) << '\n';

    food.resize_and_overwrite
    (
        resize_to,
        [food_size = food.size()](char* p, std::size_t n) noexcept -> std::size_t
        {
            // p[0]..p[n] is the assignable range
            // p[0]..p[min(n, food_size) - 1] is the readable range
            // (contents initially equal to the original string)

            // Debug print:
            std::cout << "In Operation(); n: " << n << '\n';

            // Copy fruits to the buffer p while there is enough space.
            char* first = p + food_size;

            for (char* const end = p + n; const std::string_view fruit : fruits)
            {
                char* last = first + fruit.size() + 1;
                if (last > end)
                    break;
                *first++ = ' ';
                std::ranges::copy(fruit, first);
                first = last;
            }

            const auto final_size{static_cast<std::size_t>(first - p)};

            // Debug print:
            std::cout << "In Operation(); final_size: " << final_size << '\n';

            assert(final_size <= n);
            return final_size; // Return value is the actual new length
                               // of the string, must be in range 0..n
        }
    );

    std::cout << "Finally, food.size: " << food.size()
              << ", food.capacity: " << food.capacity()
              << ", food: " << std::quoted(food) << '\n';
}
```


**Output:**
```
1. "Food: apple"
2. "Food"
3. Copy data until the buffer is full. Print data and sizes.
Initially, food.size: 5, food.capacity: 15, resize_to: 27, food: "Food:"
In Operation(); n: 27
In Operation(); final_size: 26
Finally, food.size: 26, food.capacity: 30, food: "Food: apple banana coconut"
```

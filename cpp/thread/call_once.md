template< class Callable, class... Args >
void call_once( std::once_flag& flag, Callable&& f, Args&&... args );
Executes the *Callable* object `f` exactly once, even if called concurrently from several threads.
In detail:
* If, by the time `std::call_once` is called, `flag` indicates that `f` was already called, `std::call_once` returns right away (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as ''passive'').
* Otherwise, `std::call_once` calls . Unlike the `std::thread` constructor or `std::async`, the arguments are not moved or copied because they do not need to be transferred to another thread of execution (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as ''active'').
:* If that invocation throws an exception, it is propagated to the caller of `std::call_once`, and `flag` is not flipped so that another call will be attempted (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as ''exceptional'').
:* If that invocation returns normally (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as ''returning''), `flag` is flipped, and all other calls to `std::call_once` with the same `flag` are guaranteed to be ''passive''.
All ''active'' calls on the same `flag` form a single total order consisting of zero or more ''exceptional'' calls, followed by one ''returning'' call. The end of each ''active'' call synchronizes-with the next ''active'' call in that order.
The return from the ''returning'' call synchronizes-with the returns from all ''passive'' calls on the same `flag`: this means that all concurrent calls to `std::call_once` are guaranteed to observe any side-effects made by the ''active'' call, with no additional synchronization.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `flag` - an object, for which exactly one function gets executed
- `f` - *Callable* object to invoke
- `args...` - arguments to pass to the function

## Return value

(none)

## Exceptions

* `std::system_error` if any condition prevents calls to `std::call_once` from executing as specified.
* Any exception thrown by `f`.

## Notes

If concurrent calls to `std::call_once` pass different functions `f`, it is unspecified which `f` will be called. The selected function runs in the same thread as the `std::call_once` invocation it was passed to.
Initialization of function-local statics is guaranteed to occur only once even when called from multiple threads, and may be more efficient than the equivalent code using `std::call_once`.
The POSIX equivalent of this function is [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_once.html `pthread_once`].

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

std::once_flag flag1, flag2;

void simple_do_once()
{
    std::call_once(flag1, [](){ std::cout << "Simple example: called once\n"; });
}

void may_throw_function(bool do_throw)
{
    if (do_throw)
    {
        std::cout << "Throw: call_once will retry\n"; // this may appear more than once
        throw std::exception();
    }
    std::cout << "Did not throw, call_once will not attempt again\n"; // guaranteed once
}

void do_once(bool do_throw)
{
    try
    {
        std::call_once(flag2, may_throw_function, do_throw);
    }
    catch (...) {}
}

int main()
{
    std::thread st1(simple_do_once);
    std::thread st2(simple_do_once);
    std::thread st3(simple_do_once);
    std::thread st4(simple_do_once);
    st1.join();
    st2.join();
    st3.join();
    st4.join();

    std::thread t1(do_once, true);
    std::thread t2(do_once, true);
    std::thread t3(do_once, false);
    std::thread t4(do_once, true);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();
    t4.join();
}
```


**Output:**
```
Simple example: called once
Throw: call_once will retry
Throw: call_once will retry
Throw: call_once will retry
Did not throw, call_once will not attempt again
```

```cpp
**Header:** `<`semaphore`>`
dcl|num=1|since=c++20|1=
template< std::ptrdiff_t LeastMaxValue = /* implementation-defined */ >
class counting_semaphore;
dcl|num=2|since=c++20|1=
using binary_semaphore = std::counting_semaphore<1>;
```

1. A `counting_semaphore` is a lightweight synchronization primitive that can control access to a shared resource. Unlike a `std::mutex`, a `counting_semaphore` allows more than one concurrent access to the same resource, for at least `LeastMaxValue` concurrent accessors. The program is ill-formed if `LeastMaxValue` is negative.
2. `binary_semaphore` is an alias for specialization of `std::counting_semaphore` with `LeastMaxValue` being `1`. Implementations may implement `binary_semaphore` more efficiently than the default implementation of `std::counting_semaphore`.
A `counting_semaphore` contains an internal counter initialized by the constructor. This counter is decremented by calls to `acquire()` and related methods, and is incremented by calls to `release()`. When the counter is zero, `acquire()` blocks until the counter is incremented, but `try_acquire()` does not block; `try_acquire_for()` and `try_acquire_until()` block until the counter is incremented or a timeout is reached.
Similar to `std::condition_variable::wait()`, `counting_semaphore`'s `try_acquire()` can spuriously fail.
Specializations of `std::counting_semaphore` are not *DefaultConstructible*, *CopyConstructible*, *MoveConstructible*, *CopyAssignable*, or *MoveAssignable*.

## Notes

As its name indicates, the `LeastMaxValue` is the ''minimum'' max value, not the ''actual'' max value. Thus `max()` can yield a number larger than `LeastMaxValue`.
Unlike `std::mutex` a `counting_semaphore` is not tied to threads of execution - acquiring a semaphore can occur on a different thread than releasing the semaphore, for example. All operations on `counting_semaphore` can be performed concurrently and without any relation to specific threads of execution, with the exception of the destructor which cannot be performed concurrently but can be performed on a different thread.
Semaphores are also often used for the semantics of signaling/notifying rather than mutual exclusion, by initializing the semaphore with `0` and thus blocking the receiver(s) that try to `acquire()`, until the notifier "signals" by invoking `release(n)`. In this respect semaphores can be considered alternatives to `std::condition_variable`s, often with better performance.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <semaphore>
#include <thread>

// global binary semaphore instances
// object counts are set to zero
// objects are in non-signaled state
std::binary_semaphore
    smphSignalMainToThread{0},
    smphSignalThreadToMain{0};

void ThreadProc()
{
    // wait for a signal from the main proc
    // by attempting to decrement the semaphore
    smphSignalMainToThread.acquire();

    // this call blocks until the semaphore's count
    // is increased from the main proc

    std::cout << "[thread] Got the signal\n"; // response message

    // wait for 3 seconds to imitate some work
    // being done by the thread
    using namespace std::literals;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(3s);

    std::cout << "[thread] Send the signal\n"; // message

    // signal the main proc back
    smphSignalThreadToMain.release();
}

int main()
{
    // create some worker thread
    std::thread thrWorker(ThreadProc);

    std::cout << "[main] Send the signal\n"; // message

    // signal the worker thread to start working
    // by increasing the semaphore's count
    smphSignalMainToThread.release();

    // wait until the worker thread is done doing the work
    // by attempting to decrement the semaphore's count
    smphSignalThreadToMain.acquire();

    std::cout << "[main] Got the signal\n"; // response message
    thrWorker.join();
}
```


**Output:**
```
[main] Send the signal
[thread] Got the signal
[thread] Send the signal
[main] Got the signal
```

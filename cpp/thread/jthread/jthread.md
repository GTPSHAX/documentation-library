```

Constructs new `std::jthread` object.
1. Creates new `std::jthread` object which does not represent a thread.
2. Move constructor. Constructs the `std::jthread` object to represent the thread of execution that was represented by `other`. After this call `other` no longer represents a thread of execution.
3. Creates new `std::jthread` object and associates it with a thread of execution.
The new thread of execution starts executing:
<sup>(until C++23)</sup> box|`std::invoke(`
rev|since=c++23|
if the expression above is well-formed, otherwise starts executing:
<sup>(until C++23)</sup> box|`std::invoke(`.
rev|since=c++23|
.
@@ <sup>(until C++23)</sup> The calls of <sup>(since C++23)</sup> The values produced by `auto` are materialized in the current thread, so that any exceptions thrown during evaluation and copying/moving of the arguments are thrown in the current thread, without starting the new thread.
@@ .
@@ If any of the following is `false`, the program is ill-formed:
* `std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<F>, F>`
* `(std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<Args>, Args> && ...)`
*
@@ The completion of the invocation of the constructor synchronizes with the beginning of the invocation of the copy of `f` on the new thread of execution.
4. The copy constructor is deleted; threads are not copyable. No two `std::jthread` objects may represent the same thread of execution.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `other` - another `std::jthread` object to construct this `std::jthread` object with
- `f` - *Callable* object to execute in the new thread
- `args` - arguments to pass to the new function

## Postconditions

1.  equal to `cpp/thread/thread/id|std::jthread::id()` (i.e.  returns `false`) and `get_stop_source().stop_possible()` is `false`.
2. `other.get_id()` equal to `cpp/thread/thread/id|std::jthread::id()` and  returns the value of `other.get_id()` prior to the start of construction.
3.  not equal to `cpp/thread/thread/id|std::jthread::id()` (i.e.  returns `true`), and `get_stop_source().stop_possible()` is `true`.

## Exceptions

3. `std::system_error` if the thread could not be started. The exception may represent the error condition `std::errc::resource_unavailable_try_again` or another implementation-specific error condition.

## Notes

The arguments to the thread function are moved or copied by value. If a reference argument needs to be passed to the thread function, it has to be wrapped (e.g. with `std::ref` or `std::cref`).
Any return value from the function is ignored. If the function throws an exception, `std::terminate` is called. In order to pass return values or exceptions back to the calling thread, `std::promise` or `std::async` may be used.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <utility>

using namespace std::literals;

void f1(int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
    {
        std::cout << "Thread 1 executing\n";
        ++n;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(10ms);
    }
}

void f2(int& n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
    {
        std::cout << "Thread 2 executing\n";
        ++n;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(10ms);
    }
}

class foo
{
public:
    void bar()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
        {
            std::cout << "Thread 3 executing\n";
            ++n;
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(10ms);
        }
    }
    int n = 0;
};

class baz
{
public:
    void operator()()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
        {
            std::cout << "Thread 4 executing\n";
            ++n;
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(10ms);
        }
    }
    int n = 0;
};

int main()
{
    int n = 0;
    foo f;
    baz b;
    std::jthread t0; // t0 is not a thread
    std::jthread t1(f1, n + 1); // pass by value
    std::jthread t2a(f2, std::ref(n)); // pass by reference
    std::jthread t2b(std::move(t2a)); // t2b is now running f2(). t2a is no longer a thread
    std::jthread t3(&foo::bar, &f); // t3 runs foo::bar() on object f
    std::jthread t4(b); // t4 runs baz::operator() on a copy of object b
    t1.join();
    t2b.join();
    t3.join();
    std::cout << "Final value of n is " << n << '\n';
    std::cout << "Final value of f.n (foo::n) is " << f.n << '\n';
    std::cout << "Final value of b.n (baz::n) is " << b.n << '\n';
    // t4 joins on destruction
}
```

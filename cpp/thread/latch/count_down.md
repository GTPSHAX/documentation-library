title: std::latch::count_down
type: Concurrency support
source: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/latch/count_down
---


```cpp
dcl|since=c++20|1=
void count_down( std::ptrdiff_t n = 1 );
```

Atomically decrements the internal counter by `n` without blocking the caller.
If `n` is greater than the value of the internal counter or is negative, the behavior is undefined.
This operation strongly happens-before all calls that are unblocked on this `latch`.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `n` - the value by which the internal counter is decreased

## Return value

(none)

## Exceptions

Throws `std::system_error` with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.

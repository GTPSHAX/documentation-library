void notify_all_at_thread_exit( std::condition_variable& cond,
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk );
`notify_all_at_thread_exit` provides a mechanism to notify other threads that a given thread has completely finished, including destroying all `cpp/keyword/thread_local` objects. It operates as follows:
* Ownership of the previously acquired lock `lk` is transferred to internal storage.
* The execution environment is modified such that when the current thread exits, the condition variable `cond` is notified as if by .
The implied `lk.unlock()` is sequenced after the destruction of all objects with thread local storage duration associated with the current thread.
If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:
* `lk` is not locked by the calling thread.
* If some other threads are also waiting on `cond`, `lk.mutex()` is different from the mutex unlocked by the waiting functions (`wait`, `wait_for` and `wait_until`) called on `cond` by those threads.

## Notes

An equivalent effect may be achieved with the facilities provided by `std::promise` or `std::packaged_task`.
The supplied lock `lk` is held until the thread exits. Once this function has been called, no more threads may acquire the same lock in order to wait on `cond`. If some threads are waiting on this condition variable, ensure that the condition being waited for is satisfied while holding the lock on `lk`, and that this lock is not released and reacquired prior to calling `notify_all_at_thread_exit` to avoid confusion from spurious wakeups in other threads.
In typical use cases, this function is the last thing called by a detached thread.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `cond` - the condition variable to notify at thread exit
- `lk` - the lock associated with the condition variable `cond`

## Return value

(none)

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>
#include <thread>

std::mutex m;
std::condition_variable cv;

bool ready = false;
std::string result; // some arbitrary type

void thread_func()
{
    thread_local std::string thread_local_data = "42";

    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);

    // assign a value to result using thread_local data
    result = thread_local_data;
    ready = true;

    std::notify_all_at_thread_exit(cv, std::move(lk));

}   // 1. destroy thread_locals;
    // 2. unlock mutex;
    // 3. notify cv.

int main()
{
    std::thread t(thread_func);
    t.detach();

    // do other work
    // ...

    // wait for the detached thread
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);
    cv.wait(lk, []{ return ready; });

    // result is ready and thread_local destructors have finished, no UB
    assert(result == "42");
}
```

std::future<R> get_future();
Returns a future object associated with the same shared state as `*this`.
An exception is thrown if `*this` has no shared state or `get_future` has already been called. To get multiple "pop" ends of the promise-future communication channel, use `std::future::share`.
Calls to this function do not introduce data races with calls to `set_value`, `set_exception`, `set_value_at_thread_exit`, or `set_exception_at_thread_exit` (therefore they need not synchronize with each other).

## Parameters

(none)

## Return value

A future referring to the shared state of `*this`.

## Exceptions

`std::future_error` on the following conditions:
* `*this` has no shared state. The error code is set to `cpp/thread/future_errc|no_state`.
* `get_future()` has already been called on a promise with the same shared state as `*this`. The error code is set to `cpp/thread/future_errc|future_already_retrieved`.

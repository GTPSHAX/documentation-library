title: std::shared_timed_mutex::lock_shared
type: Concurrency support
source: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_timed_mutex/lock_shared
---


```cpp
|
void lock_shared();
```

Acquires shared ownership of the mutex. If another thread is holding the mutex in exclusive ownership, a call to `lock_shared` will block execution until shared ownership can be acquired.
If `lock_shared` is called by a thread that already owns the `mutex` in any mode (exclusive or shared), the behavior is undefined.
If more than the implementation-defined maximum number of shared owners already locked the mutex in shared mode, `lock_shared` blocks execution until the number of shared owners is reduced. The maximum number of owners is guaranteed to be at least 10000.
Prior `unlock()` operation on the same mutex ''synchronizes-with'' (as defined in `std::memory_order`) this operation.

## Parameters

(none)

## Return value

(none)

## Exceptions

Throws `std::system_error` when errors occur, including errors from the underlying operating system that would prevent `lock` from meeting its specifications. The mutex is not locked in the case of any exception being thrown.

## Notes

`lock_shared()` is usually not called directly: `std::shared_lock` is used to manage shared locking.

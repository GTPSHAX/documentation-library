```cpp
dcl|since=c++14|
bool try_lock_shared();
```

Tries to lock the mutex in shared mode. Returns immediately. On successful lock acquisition returns `true`, otherwise returns `false`.
This function is allowed to fail spuriously and return `false` even if the mutex is not currenly exclusively locked by any other thread.
Prior `unlock()` operation on the same mutex ''synchronizes-with'' (as defined in `std::memory_order`) this operation if it returns `true`.
The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex in any mode.

## Parameters

(none)

## Return value

`true` if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise `false`.

## Exceptions

Throws nothing.

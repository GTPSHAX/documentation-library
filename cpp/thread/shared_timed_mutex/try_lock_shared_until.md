```cpp
dcl|since=c++14|
template< class Clock, class Duration >
bool try_lock_shared_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>& timeout_time );
```

Tries to lock the mutex in shared mode. Blocks until specified `timeout_time` has been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On successful lock acquisition returns `true`, otherwise returns `false`.
If `timeout_time` has already passed, this function behaves like `try_lock_shared()`.
As with `try_lock_shared()`, this function is allowed to fail spuriously and return `false` even if the mutex was not locked by any other thread at some point before `timeout_time`.
Prior `unlock()` operation on the same mutex ''synchronizes-with'' (as defined in `std::memory_order`) this operation if it returns `true`.
If `try_lock_shared_until` is called by a thread that already owns the `mutex` in any mode (shared or exclusive), the behavior is undefined.

## Parameters


### Parameters

- `timeout_time` - maximum time point to block until

## Return value

`true` if the shared lock ownership was acquired successfully, otherwise `false`.

## Exceptions

Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw).

## Example

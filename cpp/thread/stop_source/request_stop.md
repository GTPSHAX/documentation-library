bool request_stop() noexcept;
Issues a stop request to the stop-state, if the `stop_source` object has a stop-state and it has not yet already had stop requested.
The determination is made atomically, and if stop was requested, the stop-state is atomically updated to avoid race conditions, such that:
* `stop_requested()` and `stop_possible()` can be concurrently invoked on other `stop_token`s and `stop_source`s of the same stop-state;
* `request_stop()` can be concurrently invoked on other `stop_source` objects, and only one will actually perform the stop request.
However, see the Notes section.

## Parameters

(none)

## Return value

`true` if the `stop_source` object has a stop-state and this invocation made a stop request, otherwise `false`.

## Postconditions

`stop_possible()` is `false` or `stop_requested()` is `true`.

## Notes

If the `request_stop()` does issue a stop request (i.e., returns `true`), then any `stop_callback`s registered for the same associated stop-state will be invoked synchronously, on the same thread `request_stop()` is issued on. If an invocation of a callback exits via an exception, `std::terminate` is called.
If the `stop_source` object has a stop-state but a stop request has already been made, this function returns `false`. However there is no guarantee that another `stop_source` object which has just (successfully) requested stop is not still in the middle of invoking a `stop_callback` function.
If the `request_stop()` does issue a stop request (i.e., returns `true`), then all condition variables of base type `std::condition_variable_any` registered with an interruptible wait for `stop_token`s associated with the `stop_source`'s stop-state will be notified.

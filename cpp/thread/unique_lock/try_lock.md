title: std::unique_lock::try_lock
type: Concurrency support
source: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/unique_lock/try_lock
---


```cpp
dcl|since=c++11|1=
bool try_lock();
```

Tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex without blocking. Effectively calls `mutex()->try_lock()`.
`std::system_error` is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is already locked by this `std::unique_lock`.

## Parameters

(none)

## Return value

`true` if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, `false` otherwise.

## Exceptions

* Any exceptions thrown by `mutex()->try_lock()` (*Mutex* types do not throw in `try_lock`, but a custom *Lockable* might).
* If there is no associated mutex, `std::system_error` with an error code of `std::errc::operation_not_permitted`.
* If the mutex is already locked by this `std::unique_lock`, `std::system_error` with an error code of `std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur`.

## Example


### Example

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

int main()
{
    std::mutex counter_mutex;
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    using Id = int;

    auto worker_task = [&](Id id, std::chrono::seconds wait, std::chrono::seconds acquire)
    {
        // wait for a few seconds before acquiring lock.
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(wait);

        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(counter_mutex, std::defer_lock);
        if (lock.try_lock())
            std::cout << '#' << id << ", lock acquired.\n";
        else
        {
            std::cout << '#' << id << ", failed acquiring lock.\n";
            return;
        }

        // keep the lock for a while.
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(acquire);

        std::cout << '#' << id << ", releasing lock (via destructor).\n";
    };

    threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{0}, 0s, 2s);
    threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{1}, 1s, 0s);
    threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{2}, 3s, 0s);

    for (auto& thread : threads)
        thread.join();
}
```


**Output:**
```
#0, lock acquired.
#1, failed acquiring lock.
#0, releasing lock (via destructor).
#2, lock acquired.
#2, releasing lock (via destructor).
```

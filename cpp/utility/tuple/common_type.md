struct common_type<TTuple, UTuple>;
The common type of two  types is a `std::tuple` consists of the common types of all corresponding element type pairs of both types.
Given
* `TTypes` as the pack formed by the sequence of `std::tuple_element_t<i, TTuple>` for every integer `i` in [​0, std::tuple_size_v<TTuple>), and
* `UTypes` as the pack formed by the sequence of `std::tuple_element_t<i, UTuple>` for every integer `i` in [​0, std::tuple_size_v<UTuple>),
the following constraints need to be satisfied:
* `TTuple` or `UTuple` is a `std::tuple` specialization.
* `std::is_same_v<TTuple, std::decay_t<TTuple>>` is `true`.
* `std::is_same_v<UTuple, std::decay_t<UTuple>>` is `true`.
* `std::tuple_size_v<TTuple>` equals `std::tuple_size_v<UTuple>` (`TTuple` and `UTuple` have the same number of elements).
* `std::tuple<std::common_type_t<TTypes, UTypes>...>` denotes a type.
